# Test Standards

- Test naming: `test_[system]_[scenario]_[expected_result]` pattern
- Every test must have a clear arrange/act/assert structure
- Unit tests must not depend on external state (filesystem, network, database)
- Integration tests must clean up after themselves
- Performance tests must specify acceptable thresholds and fail if exceeded
- Test data must be defined in the test or in dedicated fixtures, never shared mutable state
- Mock external dependencies — tests should be fast and deterministic
- Every bug fix must have a regression test that would have caught the original bug —
  and **you must watch it fail before you trust it.** Run the new test against the
  unfixed code, confirm it fails, then apply the fix and confirm it passes. A
  regression test that has only ever been seen passing is not known to test anything.

## Examples

**Correct** (proper naming + Arrange/Act/Assert):

```gdscript
func test_health_system_take_damage_reduces_health() -> void:
    # Arrange
    var health := HealthComponent.new()
    health.max_health = 100
    health.current_health = 100

    # Act
    health.take_damage(25)

    # Assert
    assert_eq(health.current_health, 75)
```

**Incorrect**:

```gdscript
func test1() -> void:  # VIOLATION: no descriptive name
    var h := HealthComponent.new()
    h.take_damage(25)  # VIOLATION: no arrange step, no clear assert
    assert_true(h.current_health < 100)  # VIOLATION: imprecise assertion
```
