If no argument is provided, output usage guidance and exit without spawning any agents:
> Usage: `/team-audio [feature or area]` — specify the feature or area to design audio for (e.g., `combat`, `main menu`, `forest biome`, `boss encounter`). Do not use `AskUserQuestion` here; output the guidance directly.

When this skill is invoked with an argument, orchestrate the audio team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** At each step transition, use `AskUserQuestion` to present
the user with the subagent's proposals as selectable options. Write the agent's
full analysis in conversation, then capture the decision with concise labels.
In `collaborative` mode, the user must approve before moving to the next step.
In `guided` mode the pipeline advances automatically unless a step is BLOCKED;
in `autonomous` mode it runs end to end, recording each step outcome via
`log_decision`. Decisions in `automation_always_ask` categories
(`is_always_ask_category` helper) always prompt regardless of mode. See
`.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`.

## Phase 0: Resolve Config

!`bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys review_mode,automation,team.size`

Resolved above — use as-is; `--review` overrides `review_mode`. No block →
defaults in `.claude/docs/config-resolution.md`.

`review_mode` sets gate depth:
- `full` — spawn all director and lead gates as described
- `lean` — skip director gates unless they are PHASE-GATE type (CD-PHASE-GATE, TD-PHASE-GATE, PR-PHASE-GATE, AD-PHASE-GATE)
- `solo` — skip all director gate spawning entirely; run the skill without any agent gates

`automation` drives the Decision Points note above. See the Decision Points note above and
`.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` for how each mode changes pipeline behavior.

**`team.size`**: which agents are active (orthogonal to review_mode gate-depth and workflow docs).
- **`individual`** (default): `sound-designer` only. Other agents consulted via the sound-designer, not spawned separately.
- **`small`**: + `audio-director` + `technical-artist`.
- **`studio`**: + `localization-lead` + per-system audio reviewers.
Directors (CD/TD/PR) still spawn at phase gates regardless of size; a non-core agent needed at `individual` routes through the nearest active core agent with an informational note. **"Phase gate" means any phase that ends in an `AskUserQuestion` decision point before the pipeline advances** — not every phase. Apply the test literally: if the phase below has no decision point, it is not a gate, and an agent restricted to "phase gates only" is not spawned for it. This active-set scoping applies throughout the pipeline below: any phase that names an agent outside the active set routes through the nearest core agent rather than spawning it.

**Announce the active set before Step 1 — never let the collapse be silent.**
Before spawning anything, state in one line which agents this run will actually
spawn, and which the pipeline below names but will **not** spawn at the resolved
`team.size`. For example:

> `Active set (team.size: <resolved>): <the agents listed for that size above>.`
> `Not spawned this run: <every other agent this pipeline names> — consulted`
> `through <nearest active core agent>. Raise team.size (or modes.rigor) to widen.`

Fill it from the `team.size` list directly above and the agents this file's own
pipeline names — not from an example. Both sets differ per orchestrator.

The pipeline below reads as a multi-agent fan-out and at the shipped default it
is one or two agents — `team-release` names eight and runs one, `team-narrative`
names six across five phases and runs `writer` alone. **The collapse is correct**:
`team.size` is rigor-fronted and the narrow default is the token lever, measured
at roughly 10x. What was wrong is that nothing said so, so a reader could not
distinguish a correctly-collapsed run from a broken pipeline, and the per-agent
"routes through the nearest core agent with an informational note" rule above
fires at routing time and never states the shape of the run as a whole.

This is the same rule as the skipped-check reporting elsewhere in this file: **a constraint that is enforced but never surfaced is
indistinguishable, to the person reading the output, from one that was never
enforced.**

1. **Read the argument** for the target feature or area (e.g., `combat`,
   `main menu`, `forest biome`, `boss encounter`).

2. **Gather context**:
   - Read relevant design docs in `design/gdd/` for the feature
   - Read the sound bible at `design/gdd/sound-bible.md` if it exists
   - Read existing audio asset lists in `assets/audio/`
   - Read any existing sound design docs for this area

## How to Delegate

Use the `Agent` tool to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: audio-director` — Sonic identity, emotional tone, audio palette
- `subagent_type: sound-designer` — SFX specifications, audio events, mixing groups
- `subagent_type: technical-artist` — Audio middleware, bus structure, memory budgets
- `subagent_type: [primary engine specialist]` — Validate audio integration patterns for the engine
- `subagent_type: gameplay-programmer` — Audio manager, gameplay triggers, adaptive music

**Brief each agent — do not dump context.** Read the shared inputs **once** and pass a distilled brief inline: the lines each agent actually needs, never a file path for a document you have already read (an agent handed a path re-reads the whole file). Pass a path only for a document you have not read and only that agent needs.

**End every agent prompt with a return contract:** "Write your full output to `[path]` — that named path is your write authorisation under the bounded exception below, so write it without a separate approval prompt. Return **only** (1) the path written, (2) a ≤5-bullet summary of decisions, (3) any BLOCKED/CONCERNS items, one line each. Do not restate the documents you read." Without it, an agent returns everything it read back into this session.

> **Why this does not violate the Collaboration Protocol.** `CLAUDE.md` requires an agent to ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before Write/Edit. A subagent spawned here writes **without** asking, and that is a deliberate, bounded exception rather than an oversight — the same call already made for `consistency-check` appending to `active.md`. The exception holds only when all three are true: (1) the path is one **you** named in the prompt, so the user approved the destination when they approved the phase; (2) it is a new artifact under `production/`, `docs/` or `tests/`, never an edit to existing source or config; (3) the phase that produced it is itself gated by an `AskUserQuestion` before the pipeline advances. Outside those three, the agent must ask. **Do not "fix" this by asking per subagent** — a prompt per agent per phase makes an orchestrator unusable, which is why the exception exists.

3. **Orchestrate the audio team** in sequence:

### Step 1: Audio Direction (audio-director)
Spawn the `audio-director` agent to:
- Define the sonic identity for this feature/area
- Specify the emotional tone and audio palette
- Set music direction (adaptive layers, stems, transitions)
- Define audio priorities and mix targets
- Establish any adaptive audio rules (combat intensity, exploration, tension)

### Step 2: Sound Design and Audio Accessibility (parallel)
Spawn the `sound-designer` agent to:
- Create detailed SFX specifications for every audio event
- Define sound categories (ambient, UI, gameplay, music, dialogue)
- Specify per-sound parameters (volume range, pitch variation, attenuation)
- Plan audio event list with trigger conditions
- Define mixing groups and ducking rules

Spawn the `accessibility-specialist` agent in parallel to:
- Identify which audio events carry critical gameplay information (damage received, enemy nearby, objective complete) and require visual alternatives for hearing-impaired players
- Specify subtitle requirements: which audio events need captions, what text format, on-screen duration
- Check that no gameplay state is communicated by audio alone (all must have a visual fallback)
- Review the audio event list for any that could cause issues for players with auditory sensitivities (high-frequency alerts, sudden loud events)
- Output: audio accessibility requirements list integrated into the audio event spec

### Step 3: Technical Implementation (parallel)
Spawn the `technical-artist` agent to:
- Design the audio middleware integration (Wwise/FMOD/native)
- Define audio bus structure and routing
- Specify memory budgets for audio assets per platform
- Plan streaming vs preloaded asset strategy
- Design any audio-reactive visual effects

Spawn the **primary engine specialist** in parallel (`<engine>-specialist` derived from `engine.name` — Godot→`godot-specialist`, Unity→`unity-specialist`, Unreal→`unreal-specialist`; fall back to the Primary line of `## Engine Specialists` in `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`) to validate the integration approach:
- Is the proposed audio middleware integration idiomatic for the engine? (e.g., Godot's built-in AudioStreamPlayer vs FMOD, Unity's Audio Mixer vs Wwise, Unreal's MetaSounds vs FMOD)
- Any engine-specific audio node/component patterns that should be used?
- Known audio system changes in the pinned engine version that affect the integration plan?
- Output: engine audio integration notes to merge with the technical-artist's plan

If no engine is configured, skip the specialist spawn. **Record `Engine validation: NOT ASSESSED — no engine configured (`engine.name` unset in `project.yaml`)` in this run's output.** A skipped check that says nothing is indistinguishable from a check that passed; the reader cannot tell engine guidance was never sought.

### Step 4: Code Integration (gameplay-programmer)
Spawn the `gameplay-programmer` agent to:
- Implement audio manager system or review existing
- Wire up audio events to gameplay triggers
- Implement adaptive music system (if specified)
- Set up audio occlusion/reverb zones
- Write unit tests for audio event triggers

4. **Compile the audio design document** combining all team outputs.

5. **Save to** `design/audio/audio-[feature].md` — **but ask first.** `design/` is
   NOT one of the three directories the bounded write exception covers
   (`production/`, `docs/`, `tests/`), so a sub-agent handed this path must
   prompt, and one has done exactly that. Do not
   resolve that by widening the exception. Instead, follow the same pattern
   `team-level` uses: **you** already hold every sub-agent's output, so compile
   the document yourself and ask directly via `AskUserQuestion` — "May I write the
   audio design to `design/audio/audio-[feature].md`?" — then write it on
   approval. Sub-agent working artifacts stay under `production/` where the
   exception does reach them.

   Note: If `design/audio/` does not exist, the sub-agent writing the document should create it (the directory will be created automatically when the file is written).

6. **Output a summary** with: audio event count, estimated asset count,
   implementation tasks, and any open questions between team members.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — audio design document produced and team pipeline finished.

If the pipeline stops because a dependency is unresolved (e.g., critical accessibility gap or missing GDD not resolved by the user):

Verdict: **BLOCKED** — [reason]

## File Write Protocol

All file writes (audio design docs, SFX specs, implementation files) are delegated
to sub-agents spawned via `Agent`. Those writes follow the **bounded exception**
documented above under "Why this does not violate the Collaboration Protocol" —
the path is one you named, the artifact is new under `production/`, `docs/` or
`tests/`, and the phase is gated by an `AskUserQuestion`. A sub-agent does **not**
prompt per write inside those bounds; outside them it must ask. This orchestrator
does not write files directly.

## Next Steps

- Review the audio design doc with the audio-director before implementation begins.
- Use `/dev-story` to implement the audio manager and event system once the design is approved.
- Run `/asset-audit` after audio assets are created to verify naming and format compliance.

## Error Recovery Protocol

**First, verify the artifact.** If the return contract named a path, check the
path exists before treating the phase as done — **a named artifact that is not
on disk is a failed phase, however fluent the response reads.** An agent can
burn a full phase and return a plausible preamble having written nothing, which
is neither BLOCKED nor an error nor "cannot complete", so the trigger below
never fires. Resume it naming the unmet contract; the context is
usually still there.

If any spawned agent returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete: **surface it
immediately, don't proceed past a dependency it blocks, and always produce a
partial report.** Full procedure: `.claude/docs/error-recovery-protocol.md`.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; run `/architecture-decision` first
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `/create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess
