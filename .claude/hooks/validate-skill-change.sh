# --- work from the project root ----------------------------------------------
# Every path below is repo-relative, so a hook invoked with a working directory
# that is not the repo root would silently read and write the WRONG TREE --
# returning a near-empty result instead of the session-recovery block, and
# creating stray trees such as docs/production/session-logs/ on write.
#
# PRECEDENCE IS LOAD-BEARING. A cwd that IS a project root carries real
# information and must win: a caller sitting inside another project means that
# project, not this one. Resolving to the script's own location first would
# override them. So, in order:
#   1. cwd holds project.yaml   -> cwd   (a project root)
#   2. cwd holds .claude/       -> cwd   (a project root not yet configured)
#   3. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR       -> that  (populated in the hook environment)
#   4. this script's location   -> <root>/.claude/hooks/../.. by construction
# Rule 4 always works and needs no environment at all; rules 1-2 stop it from
# overriding a caller that legitimately means somewhere else.
#
# NOT an upward search: that resolves a nested project to its parent's config.

# the grep fallback CANNOT -- it hands back the raw two-character `\\`. A
# single `s|\\|/|g` then turns each of those into its own slash, producing
# `.claude//skills//help//SKILL.md`, which no path test below matches. The hook
# went silent on every Windows edit whenever jq was absent -- and jq is absent
# on a stock Windows Git Bash, which is this project's primary platform.
#
# Rule 1 collapses the escaped pair to one slash; rule 2 handles an already
# unescaped separator (the jq path, or a POSIX caller). Running both is safe
# for either input because rule 1 finds nothing to do on unescaped text.
